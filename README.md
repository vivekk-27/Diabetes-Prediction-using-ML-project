# Diabeties-Prediction-using-ML-project

This description tells how the code must be executed. 

This project needs to be opened in the GOOGLE COLABORATORY.

A CSV file named "Diabetes.csv" is provided along with the code which needs to be pasted in the files section of the project just beneath the folder/file named sample-data. This csv file contains all the dataset for the project.

After pasting the csv file, the block of codes must be executed 1 by 1, most of the code blocks contains a comment showing what exactly is being done in that particular block. 

After all this, during the last step (making of the predictive system), the csv file must be opened in notepad to take any random input for checking the proper functioning of the predictive system. 
This step is necessary in order to check the proper functioning of the preddictive system. Any random input must be taken from the file (exckuding the last column) and that input is then fed into our machine which predicts whether the person is Diabeic or not. 
Once the machine has predicted its answer,  it must be compared with the column value of the file that we excluded from the input.

if Machine's Output == Actual Output 
   Then, our machine is working exactly like we want it to and absolutely fine.

if machine's output != Actual Output
   Then, our machine is not working the way we wanted.
